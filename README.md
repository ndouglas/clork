An attempt to remake _Zork_ in Clojure.

## Background

_Zork_ had a huge impact on me. I was a poor kid without a computer, but I could "check out" a computer from the school district - an Apple //e, I think - which came with a number of games and other software, including the _Zork_ trilogy.

I wasn't a terribly savvy gamer and not good at creating coherent maps (not that _Zork_ makes this easy) or recording my experiments, so a lot of my experience with the games was to load _Zork I_, play it until I was ready to throw the computer out the window, then repeat that with _Zork II_, _Zork III_, and then I was ready to go back to _Zork I_. I spent a lot of time too frustrated to do anything but rest my head on my arms while the Apple hummed steadily in the background.

I couldn't make head nor tails of a lot of the puzzles (though I muddled through many of them), but that often mattered less than you might think. I spent a lot of time just wandering around. Being young and naïve about video game tropes (so many of which this game invented!), I spent a lot of time in places like FOREST-3 - "a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around" but with "no tree... suitable for climbing," where "the rank undergrowth prevents eastward movement" and "storm-tossed trees block your way" south. I thought, perhaps, there was some way to get beyond this and go to other parts of the world, find other parts of the Great Underground Empire, etc.

I had to return that borrowed //e eventually, but there were other ways I could interact with _Zork_. I read the CYOA-esque books. I  wrote short stories that borrowed heavily from its magic system, its worldbuilding, and its unique blend of juvenile humor and wistful melancholia. And my earliest independent programming projects, once I finally got my own computer, were writing my own "interactive fiction" games in QBASIC, TADS, and Inform 5 or 6. Despite its age, substantial design issues, and various other limitations, _Zork_ is still a cornerstone of how I think about game design, storytelling, etc.
