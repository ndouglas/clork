    },
    {
      "command": "e",
      "response": "Behind House\n\nYou are behind the white house. A path leads into the forest to the east. In one corner of the house there is a small window which is slightly ajar."

      "command": "open window",
      "response": "With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry."

      "response": "Kitchen\n\nYou are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east is a small window which is open.\n\nOn the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.\n\nA bottle is sitting on the table.\n\nThe glass bottle contains:\n\nA quantity of water"

      "command": "w",
      "response": "Living Room\n\nYou are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.\n\nAbove the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.\n\nA battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case."

      "command": "d",
      "response": "The trap door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.\n\nIt is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.\n\nYour sword is glowing with a faint blue glow."

    {
      "command": "turn on lamp",
      "response": "The brass lantern is now on. Cellar\n\nYou are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading north, and a crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable."

    {
      "command": "n",
      "response": "The Troll Room\n\nThis is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.\n\nA nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.\n\nYour sword has begun to glow very brightly.\n\nThe axe sweeps past as you jump aside."

      "command": "attack troll with sword",
      "response": "The troll is momentarily disoriented and can't fight back.\n\nThe troll slowly regains his feet."
    },
    {
      "command": "attack troll with sword",
      "response": "The fatal blow strikes the troll square in the heart: He dies.\n\nAlmost as soon as the troll breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared.\n\nYour sword is no longer glowing."

A skeleton, probably the remains of a luckless adventurer, lies here.\n\nThe deceased adventurer's useless lantern is here.\n\nBeside the skeleton is a rusty knife.\n\nAn old leather bag, bulging with coins, is here.\n\nThere is a skeleton key here."
