Welcome to another FAQ of mine. This one covers the PC game known as Zork I.
This magnificent game is part of a number of other Zork games, all of which are
difficult text-based adventure games, which is probably the reason you came
here. Well, you need help, and I shall do by best to give it.

...

Yeah, I don't know much to say about this. But try to enjoy.

This game is one of a wide genre of text-based adventure games. In this game,
like many of them, you'll directly enter your commands into the command prompt
on-screen. There are a number of different ways to say things, but you had best
be sure in what you want to say.


Cardinal Directions:
````````````````````

These can say in the form "Go/head/walk ___", or just "___". The blank is the
direction or an acceptable abbreviation as below.

 - North     (N)
 - East      (E)
 - South     (S)
 - West      (W)
 - Northeast (NE)
 - Northwest (NW)
 - Southeast (SE)
 - Southwest (SW)
 - Up        (U)
 - Down      (D)



Actions:
````````

There are a number of things you are supposed to do. A lot of them can mean the
same thing. Here are a number of them that function properly, thanks to TUI.

                    ANSWER          FOLLOW          SAY
                    ATTACK          GIVE            SEARCH
                    BLOW            INFLATE         SHAKE
                    BREAK           JUMP            SLIDE
                    BURN            KICK            SMELL
                    CLIMB           KNOCK           STAY
                    CLOSE           LIGHT           STRIKE
                    COUNT           LISTEN          SWIM
                    CROSS           LOCK            TAKE
                    CUT             LOOK            TELL
                    DEFLATE         LOWER           THROW
                    DIG             MOVE            TIE
                    DRINK           OPEN            TOUCH
                    DROP            POUR            TURN
                    EAT             PRAY            UNLOCK
                    ENTER           PULL            WAKE
                    EXAMINE         PUSH            WALK
                    EXIT            PUT             WAVE
                    EXTINGUISH      RAISE           WEAR
                    FILL            READ            WIND



Spelling/Grammar:
`````````````````

It goes without saying. Don't screw it up. Most commands, except directions,
should have a verb and noun in them.

Also, be specific. Don't just say "fight". Like when fighting the troll near
the start, saying "fight" assumes with your hands. Instead, say "Fight with
sword" or, even better, "Fight troll with sword". This way, exactly what you
want to do is conveyed properly.



Miscellaneous Commands:
```````````````````````

There are a number of other commands available to you. Here are the ones I know
of, with suitable abbreviations within parentheses, and grouped together by
similar/related effects.

 - Verbose   : Whenever you re-enter a room, you'll get another description.
 - Brief     : Returns verbosity to normal, starting setting.
 - Superbrief: Only a room's name and items are detailed.
 - Look (L)  : Get a redescription of the room.

 - Diagnose: Learn of current condition. Imagine your wound status like HP.
             Perfect health is 3/3 HP, hit with a light wound is 2/3 HP, and
             hit with a serious wound is 1/3 HP.

 - Inventory (I): Find out all of the items on your person.

 - Score: Get your rank, moves, and score. Scores are out of 350.

 - Again (G): Repeat the last command you used.
 - Wait (Z) : Use three moves consecutively with nothing occurring. Often used
              to heal wounds.

 - Save    : Save a game.
 - Restore : Load a saved game.
 - Restart : Begin a new game.
 - Quit (Q): Completely exit the game.



Absolute Randomness:
````````````````````

There are a number of things in this game you can do that have pretty much no
use in the game at all, except for fun or something. This is just pretty much
my documentation for random commands that result in rather humorous effects.
There's nothing much to gain from doing any of these.

And, no, I don't plan on adding to this list. What's here is what's here; if
you find something else, great, but it's not pertinent to the game.


 - Jump, Hop, Leap, etc.: Generally, you'll get insulted, but in some areas
                          that are high up, you often get killed.

 - Scream, Shout, etc.: "Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!"

 - Cut Self: With the sword in your possession, you'll go all emo and die.

 - Throw __ at Self: Basically the above. Can be done with the leaflet. May
                     kill you, may not.

 - Eat Self: "Auto-cannibalism is not the answer."

 - Rape ___: "What an (ahem!) strange idea."

 - Kiss Me: "I'd sooner kiss a pig."

 - Love: "I don't know the word 'love'."

 - Kill Me with Me: "You don't have the you."

 - Zork: "At your service." I guess the narrator is named Zork?

 - Down: When in the kitchen, "Only Santa Claus goes down chimneys."

 - Read Door: When in living room, "This space intentionally left blank."

 |  to look at a different FAQ. (Not to bash those FAQs, of course. It just  |

House and Forest:
`````````````````

Once you begin, you can open the mailbox and read the leaflet if you want, but
it is by no means required. (It is also fun to throw the leaflet at yourself.)
Anyways, head north from the house twice and go up the tree there.

At the top, in the bird's next, should be an ornate, jeweled egg. Bet that hurt
coming out.  :P  Anyways, take it. Don't worry about opening it - while you can
do so (just throw the egg while up here), it will damage the contents within,
so forget about. We'll get someone else to open it.

Go on down and south, then east. You should have a window near you on the
house; open it and enter the house. Take the bottle and go west. Open the case
there and take the sword and the lantern, which will become quite familiar to
you as you continue throughout this and other Zork games.

Next, go east and up the stairs to the attack. Turn on the lantern and take the
rope. Turn off the lantern (it will eventually run out if left on, and we need
it a lot in this game), then go back downstairs. Go west and move the rug in
the living room.

Open the trap door and go on down. As luck would have it, the door closes above
you, preventing the need for you to do so yourself. ... Oh, wait.



Trollz!:
````````

Here, turn the lantern on, lest a wandering grue devour you. (What the heck is
a grue, anyways?) Then take note of how your sword is somewhat glowing - it
glows like this with an enemy is in an adjacent room, and grows brightly when
they are in the same room as yourself.

Thusly, opt to "save" the game. That way, if you get your head chopped off or
something, you can "restore" the game back to this point. Afterwards, go north
and you'll find the troll. Pretty much just fight the troll with your sword -
it may take more than one hit, but keep going until  *someone*  bites the dust.

After the fight, "diagnose" your condition. If you're able to be killed with a
light wound, I'd use the "wait" command until my wounds healed up a bit, as we
will be fighting some enemies soon enough, but they generally won't seriously
wound you.



The Underground Maze:
`````````````````````

After defeat the troll, go west. You'll find this area to be one of the most
baffling you'll ever encounter as, if you go one way, you generally cannot
trace your steps back.  O_o  It would be prudent to follow my directions to
the letter.

Also, during the course of the maze, you may meet up with some kind of man, who
may steal from you. You don't particularly want this, so save before going any
further. He can also attack you. You will want to check your inventory (just
use "inventory") after the encounters. If you have a sword, lantern, bottle,
and coins (if you're that far), then there's no real need to worry about
restoring, since you want him to take the jeweled egg. Otherwise, restore.
(If you don't get him to steal it, don't worry.)

Anyways, once in the maze, go south, east, and up. Don't mess with the
skeleton here or you'll lose everything, and that is not good. Take just the
bag of coins, then go southwest, east, south, and southeast to the Cyclops's
room.

What do you do about him? Well, anyone remember Greek mythology? Basically,
just input the command "Say 'Ulysses'" and the Cyclops will run off, leaving
a metaphorical trail of urine behind him.



The Land of the Living Dead:
````````````````````````````

Did the thief take the egg from you? If not, save in the Cyclops room and go
up. You'll find the thief's hideout; he may wound you, but it is very unlikely
to be serious. Give the egg to the thief and go back down. We'll kill him
later, don't worry.  >:)

Then go southeast, east, and east. Hey, this area's familiar. Put the treasures
into the case, open the trap door, and go down. Head north, east, north,
northeast, and east. Go north into the dam lobby and take the matchbook. Go
south twice to the Deep Canyon and go down.

Then go west, southeast, and east to the Dome Room. Save and jump for a bit of
fun, but it is counterintuitive (you lose items, even if you go where you need
to). After that, tie the rope to the railing and head down to the Torch Room.

Go south and take the bell, then south again. Take the book and the candles.
Also consider reading the book, though it isn't required. Go down from here
and repeat this action.

Welcome to Hell! That is to say, the Entrance to Hades. So, Greek Hell. Now,
then, let us exorcise the crap out of those devilish spirits...

Open the matchbook, then ring the bell to stop the spirits. This will cause
you to drop the candles; don't worry. Light a match, then light the candles
with this match. Wave the candles and you'll scare the living crap out of
those spirits. Read the book (again, possibly) to get rid of them. Nice.

Pour some water on the bell, then take the bell - it grew hot and you dropped
it, too, remember? Put out the candles as well, then drop the bottle. Go south
you'll find an ornate skull. Take it.



The Thief:
``````````

After taking the skull, go north, up, north, north, north, west, west, south,
south, and east. Take the painting here and go west, north, and up. Hey, I
know this place! Put the painting into the case to lighten your load.

Take the bag of coins and go west, then west again to the Cyclops room. Save
here and we can deal with the thief. There are two big methods as to how to do
so.

The main one is the most obvious. Go up and restore the game until you end up
not getting hit upon entrance. Then give the coins to the thief, then "Kill
thief with sword". You may get a hit on him; you need to give him a light wound
at least. Otherwise, restore. Then repeat this, but hand over the skull first.
Then just keep bashing at him. You might get lucky.

The second one is a lot easier. Go up and "Get stiletto". You'll likely fail;
don't worry. Go back down and use the "G" command. Due to some bad programming,
you'll then actually receive the stiletto. Go upstairs and repeatedly try to
kill the thief with the stiletto. Lot easier, ain't it? As with the previous
method, you can give the thief the coins/skull to distract him as needed.

Once you win the battle, take all of the treasures. (Let your wounds heal if
needed.) Then go down, east, and east. Put all of the treasures into the case.
Go west, west, and up, take the stiletto (if you need to), then go down, east,
and east. (If you already had the stiletto, for whatever reason, ignore this
last bit.)



Draining the Reservoir:
```````````````````````

After the above, save. Take the clockwork canary (it is what was in the jeweled
egg), then go east, east, north, north, and up. Wind the canary. Huh.

Go down and take the brass bauble, and go south, east, west, west, and put all
of the treasures into the case. Save if you want.

Now, onto the actual business. Go down, north, east, north, northeast, and east
to find the controls for the dam. We'll mess with it later - go north and north
again. Switch off the lantern and press the red button. Only take the
screwdriver, then push the yellow button. Go south two times and turn the bolt
with the wrench.

Wait a few times and the reservoir will soon drain. Go west and turn on the
lantern, then north. Drop all but the lantern and go north twice. Take the
trident - you know who that's a reference to, right? - and go south twice. Take
the trunk and go south, southwest, southwest, west, south, and up. Put all of
the treasures in the case.



Coal and Diamonds:
``````````````````

Go east and open the sack there. Take the garlic - as if you'd eat it! - and go
west, down, north, east, north, northeast, and north. Take all the crap you
dropped before. Go north twice.

Then go up, north, north, west, north, west, and north. Get the figurine and go
east. Put the screwdriver, matchbook, and candles into the basket; we'll do
more with this later.

Go north, down, and take the bracelet. Then go east, northeast, southeast,
southwest, down, down, and west. Drop all but the lantern here and go east,
south, take the coal, north, up, up, north, east, south, north, up, and
south. Phew!

Take the candles and the matchbook. Light a match and then light the candle
with it. Put the candles and coal into the basket, then lower it. Go north,
down, east, northeast, southeast, southwest, down, down, and west.

Drop all of your stuff and go west. Hey, look! It's the basket! Take the
candles, screwdriver, and the coal. Head south and open the lid. Put the coal
into this machine and close the lid. Move the switch with the screwdriver, then
open the lid for a big freakin' diamond! Take it and go north.

Put the candles, diamond, and screwdriver into the basket. Go east and take
everything except the stiletto and timber, then go east, up, up, north, east,
south, north, up, and south. Raise the basket and take the candles and the
diamond.

May as well return to the treasure case. Go west, south, east, south, down, and
up. Put all treasures into the case.



Silence is Golden:
``````````````````

Go down, north, east, east, north, northeast, east, south, and down.

Whatever logic it seems to defy, say "Echo", and, for some random reason, the
room becomes quiet. Huh. That was easy. Take the platinum bar and go southeast,
east, and down. Turn off the lantern, then drop the lantern and the candles.
Take the torch now, which will eternally be lit.

Go south and east. Open the coffin and take the sceptre. Go west, south, down,
north, north, north, west, west, south, and up. Put all of the treasures
EXCEPT the sceptre and torch into the case. We still got stuff to do with them
pretty soon.

Go east four times, down twice, and north. You'll find the rainbow, but no
random leprechaun, north a pot of gold. Perhaps on the other side? Wave the
sceptre so we can see. Yup, that worked - take the pot of gold.

Then head east twice, north twice, and take the shovel. Go northeast and
dig in the sand with the shovel. You'll eventually, after a few repetitions of
this action, find a scarab. After this, drop the shovel, as you will no longer
need to use it. Take the scarab and go southwest, south twice, west, twice,
southwest, up twice, northwest, and west thrice. Put all treasures EXCEPT the
torch into the case.


Row, Row, Row Your Boat...:
```````````````````````````

Go down, north, east thrice, up, northwest, and north twice. Take the air pump,
as you'll obviously need it later. Go south twice, east, down, and take the
plastic. This pile of random plastic actually is an air boat. We'll use it
momentarily.

Go up, south, down, and east twice. Drop all but the pump and torch, then
"inflate plastic". Then get into the boat and launch it. Wait around for a bit
until you read something about a red buoy. Take it and land to the east.

Here, open the buoy to find an emerald. Weird place to keep treasure, but I've
seen weirder, I guess. Drop the buoy, get out of the boat, deflate the boat,
and get the plastic. Go south until you reach Aragain Falls. (Note: Niagara.)

There, go west twice, southwest, up twice, northwest, and west four times. Put
the emerald into the case, then go down, north, and east five times. Take all
but the label. (It won't be there if you read it, which is just as okay.)



Continued in Zork II...:
````````````````````````

Oh, heck no, I ain't letting you off that easily.  :P   We'll actually finish
this journey.

Go west three times, southeast, east, down, south, and east. Take the coffin -
if needed, drop all but the torch. Go west and south. Pray to find yourself
in the forest.  O_o  Now head east, south, east, and west twice. Put all of the
treasures into the case.

Read the parchment you caused to fall. Interesting... Go east twice, southwest,
northwest, and southwest. Go into the tomb and...

Huh. My game closed off. Well, given that Zork II starts in the Stone Barrow,
it is quite likely that this is the end of the game.



End-Game Evaluation:
````````````````````

When replaying the game with my walkthrough as above, making minute changes as
needed, this was my end result. Of course, the game didn't let me finish - it
just closed off, but I made my case above here - but I hit "restart" and the
game gave me the below. As such, this proves the completionistic nature of this
guide. Thanks for reading.
