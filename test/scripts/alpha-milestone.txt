; Clork Alpha Milestone Test
; Based on early Zork I walkthrough from web.mit.edu transcript
; This represents our target for "alpha" release - basic adventure gameplay
;
; Expected to fail until these verbs are implemented:
;   Movement: GO/WALK, ENTER, UP, DOWN
;   Objects: TAKE/GET, DROP, OPEN, CLOSE, READ, PUT
;   Other: MOVE, TURN ON/OFF, KILL
;
; When this script passes with --strict, we have basic playability!
